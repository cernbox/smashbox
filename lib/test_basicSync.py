__doc__ = """ Test basic sync and conflbfnicts: files are modified and deleted by one or both workers (winner and loser); optionally remove local state db on one of the clients (loser).

There are four clients (workers):

 - creator - populates the directory initially and also performs a final check
 - winner  - is syncing its local changes first
 - loser   - is syncing its local changes second (and optionally it looses the local sync database before doing the sync)
 - checker - only performs a final check (without having interacted with the system before)

Note: in 1.6 client conflict files are excluded by default - so they should be never propagated to the server
Note: in 1.5 the exclusion list should be provided separately to the client (FIXME)

Note on effects of removing local state db (1.6):

 - any files modified remotely or locally get a conflict if both remote and local replicas exist (FIXME: this could be possibly more refined in the future based on timestamps or content checksums)
 - any files not present locally but present remotely will be downloaded (so a deletion won't be propagated)
